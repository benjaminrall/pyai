# To-do List

## Core Features

### Neural Networks
- Change inputs and build method to be more similar to keras - (None) as first input, representing ability to have different batch sizes
- Add ability to use different strides for Conv2D

### Other
- Implement Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Search Algorithms?
- Logistic Regression?
- Value Iteration?
- Research other common machine learning models

## Advanced Optional Features
- Automatic differentiation
