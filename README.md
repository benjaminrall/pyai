# PyAI Library

PyAI is an Artificial Intelligence library built from scratch using pure Python and Numpy.

The current documentation for the project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/benjaminrall/pyai/wiki).

This README will be properly created when the project has a few more features to talk about.
